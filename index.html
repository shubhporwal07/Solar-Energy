  <!-- About Solar Energy Section -->
  <section id="about" class="content-section fade-in">
    <h2>About Solar Energy</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <h3>What is Solar Energy?</h3>
      <p>Solar energy is the energy harnessed from the sun's rays, making it a renewable and sustainable resource. It is captured primarily through solar panels containing photovoltaic (PV) cells, which convert sunlight into electricity.<br><br>

        There are two main types of solar energy:<br>
        
        1. Photovoltaic (PV) Solar Energy: Directly converts sunlight into electricity using solar panels.<br>
        2. Concentrated Solar Power (CSP): Uses mirrors to focus sunlight to produce steam that drives turbines for electricity generation.<br>
        Applications include generating electricity for homes and businesses, heating water, and powering vehicles. Solar energy helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lowers air pollution, and is increasingly cost-effective, making it a key player in the transition to sustainable energy. With ongoing advancements, its role in global energy systems is expected to grow significantly.</p><br>
      <h3>How Solar Energy Works</h3>
      <p>Solar energy works by converting sunlight into electricity using two main technologies:<br><br>

        1. Photovoltaic (PV) Systems<br>
        Solar Panels: Made of solar cells (usually silicon), which absorb sunlight.<br>
        Electricity Generation: Sunlight excites electrons in the cells, creating a direct current (DC) of electricity.<br>
        Inverter: Converts DC into alternating current (AC) for use in homes and the grid.<br>
        2. Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) Systems<br>
        Solar Collectors: Use mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto a receiver.<br>
        Heat Generation: The concentrated sunlight heats a fluid to produce steam.<br>
        Turbine: The steam drives a turbine connected to a generator to produce electricity.<br>
        In summary, solar energy harnesses sunlight to generate electricity through either direct conversion in PV systems or heat generation in CSP systems, contributing to cleaner energy solutions.</p><br>
